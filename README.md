# ODBC-GAN: An integrated GAN model for outlier detection and batch correction in multi-sample and multi-modal transcriptomics.
We propose a Generative Adversarial Networks called ODBC-GAN, which can detect different types of observations (cells or spots), 
and correct bacth effects among multi-sample datasets.

# Applicable tasks
Outlier detection:
1. detect outlier cells on single-cell datasets with gene expression
2. classify subtypes of the outlier cells
3. detect outlier spots on spatial transcriptomics datasets with gene expression, position information, and slice image
4. classify subtypes of the outlier spots

Batch correction:
1. correct the batch effects among single-cell datasets with gene expression
2. correct the batch effects among vertical slice spatial transcriptomics datasets with gene expression, position information, and slice image
3. correct the batch effects among horizontal slice spatial transcriptomics datasets with gene expression, position information, and slice image
